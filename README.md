Since most of the current generations invest in stock market to rotate their money. What if an efficient model build to predict the price of an stock? 
Stock's data are time based data so we gonna use Time Series Algorithm to predict the stock price. The most commonly known stock is Apple. So i've build 
Two model which is commonly known in Time Series Algorithm known as ARIMA and SARIMAX. To find which is efficient we have used MAPE(Mean Absolute Percentage Error) to find the Accuracy of our Model.
